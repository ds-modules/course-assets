**TO DO:**

- add appropriate textbook link
- alter the bolded portions to reflect date that the assignment is due
- if needed, add an extra question or two in Q4 regarding the histograms
    - for Q4, there is code written to produce the histogram which may be overwhelming for students so based on the professor's choice, that code can be hidden to simplify the overall notebook
- make sure that the language used in the questions is clear and coherent for beginner students (simplify or reword if necessary)


```python

```
